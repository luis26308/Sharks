            <h3>Sharks do not have bones</h3>
            <p>Sharks use their gills to filter oxygen from the water. They are a special type of fish known
                "elasmobranch", which translates into fish made of cartilaginous tissues—the clear gristly stuff that
                your ears and nose tip are made of. This category also includes rays, sawfish, and skates. Their
                cartilaginous skeletons are much lighter than true bone and their large livers are full of low-density
                oils, both helping them to be buoyant.</p>
            <p>Even though sharks don't have bones, they still can fossilize. As most sharks age, they deposit calcium
                salts in their skeletal cartilage to strengthen it. The dried jaws of a shark appear and feel heavy and
                solid; much like bone. These same minerals allow most shark skeletal systems to fossilize quite nicely.
                The teeth have enamel so they show up in the fossil record too.</p>

            <h3>Most sharks have good eyesight</h3>
            <p>Most sharks can see well in dark lighted areas, have fantastic night vision, and can see colors. The back
                of sharks’ eyeballs have a reflective layer of tissue called a tapetum. This helps sharks see extremely
                well with little light.</p>

            <h3>Sharks have special electrorecepter organs</h3>
            <p>Sharks have small black spots near the nose, eyes, and mouth. These spots are the ampullae of Lorenzini –
                special electroreceptor organs that allow the shark to sense electromagnetic fields and temperature
                shifts in the ocean.</p>
